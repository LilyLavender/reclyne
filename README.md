## Credits
All of the main code was written by [LilyLambda](https://github.com/LilyLavender). Much appreciated was some conceptual help from alpha tester [SyncGX](https://twitter.com/eguzerokkuman).

*reclyne* uses [jQuery xcolor](https://github.com/infusion/jQuery-xcolor). Due to the lack of an xcolor cdn, xcolor is included in the js/plugins folder.
